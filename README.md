Treasure Haunt Game!🏆🎉
---
**Welcome to the Treasure Haunt Game!** 🏆

This is a simple yet engaging browser-based game where the player must find a hidden treasure on a map by clicking on it. The game will guide you with hints such as "HOT", "COLD", "WARM", etc., to help you get closer to the treasure. Once you find the treasure, the game will congratulate you and display the number of clicks it took to find it.

How It Works🤔
---
Objective: Your goal is to find the hidden treasure on the map. The treasure is located at a random position, and you need to click on the map to get closer to it.

Hints: After each click, the game calculates the distance between your click and the treasure's location and gives you a hint:

Super HOT🥵! - Very close to the treasure.

Very HOT! - Close to the treasure.

HOT! - Getting closer.

Warm! - Still a bit of a distance.

COLD - Far from the treasure.

Very COLD - Almost nowhere near it.

FREEZING!🥶 - You're really far from the treasure.


Click Counter: Each time you click, the game will increment a counter. The number of clicks will help guide you through the game. If you reach 50 clicks, you'll get an encouraging message 💪. After 70 clicks, you'll receive a "GIVE UP ON THIS GAME!" message 😜.

Game Reset: Once you find the treasure 🏆, a pop-up will congratulate you 🥳, and the game will reset, generating a new treasure location 🎯.

Technologies Used💻:
----
HTML: The basic structure of the game and layout.

CSS: Styling for the game interface to make it visually appealing.

JavaScript: Game logic to handle the functionality such as random target generation, distance calculation, hints, and click counter.
